# Smart Garbage Segregation

## 📌 Overview

Smart Garbage Segregation is an AI/ML-based image classification project that automates the sorting of waste. It uses image recognition and machine learning techniques to classify garbage into different categories such as plastic, paper, and metal. This improves recycling efficiency and promotes sustainable waste management.
